# ChatSystem
Team project, it is a java server-client chat system. A user can create a room, inside the room channels can be created where user can communicate with other users who are part of the chat. In this project was used databases. The team spent time on creation and normalization stable and scalable database, we also used java RMI technology for server and client, moreover, we tried to use different design patterns and follow SOLID principles. For UI was chosen JavaFx framework, and for dependency managment Maven was used. Overall project gave me an opportunity to learn more about server clients systems, Scrum methodology, unit testing etc.
